# Praeses-Blackjack-Homework
This repository holds all of the files I was able to get to during my hectic class schedule and the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is not able to be run currently as I had some issues setting up a server/webpage to run it, but there is a package.json file from where I began to set that up. I implemented the code to the best of my ability to follow the core rules of blackjack.
